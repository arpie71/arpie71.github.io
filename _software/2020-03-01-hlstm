At History Lab, we used the [Structural Topic Model package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stm/index.html) for R to run topic modeling on all our collections. I wrote some functions and created an R package to make it easier to run the analysis across all our corpora. 

Note that these functions are largely wrappers for functions already in the STM package.
