I have released the raw data that Joanne Gowa and I collected for [our RTAA paper](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0043887117000302). The data, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/arpie71/rtaa) contain U.S. import data by country/territory and commodity for the years 1934 to 1946. Additionally, the data also includes tariff rates for each commodity and whether the commodity line was included under an RTAA. The data is available in Excel format as we entered it. We also have Stata and csv files of the reshaped import data available.
